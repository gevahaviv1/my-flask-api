Welcome! This assignment tests your ability to work with APIs, handle user input, and build
a simple backend application. You will use OpenAI’s GPT-4o API to complete one of the
projects below.
You can use Node.js, Python, or any other backend framework of your choice. No frontend
code is required—you will build only API endpoints, which can be tested using tools like
Postman, cURL, or Swagger.
A temporary API Key will be provided. Keep it secret, don’t upload the key to GitHub or any
shared repository, use the .env file (dotenv) to store environment variables
